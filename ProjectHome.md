# ARTionscript is an AS3 'Generative Art' Framework #


## Aim ##
The aim of this project is to decrease the barrier to entry as well as openly share code an algorithms relating to generative art.

## Concept ##
Conceptually there is a 'Studio' (Main/Document Class) which has access to 'Artists' (algorithms / rules). The 'Artist' is given a 'Canvas' (a glorified Sprite), can be given some 'Inspiration' (eg. a Flickr image / sound file) and a 'Palette' (eg. a Kuler colour theme).

The 'Artist' then creates the art work on and to the dimensions of 'Canvas'. The resulting artwork is created using his own internal algorithms, which is influenced by the 'Inspiration' and painted in colours of the 'Palette' given to him.

You can request the 'Artist' retry by pressing the Keyboard.SPACE or alternatively you can export the artwork as a bitmap using 'ctrlKey + S'.


## Contributing ##
_The code here is not perfect and we don't expect yours to be either._ So... write some code, create something crazy, rework another 'Artist', team up with others, but most importantly **share it**!

## Forum / Help ##
A forum has been set-up in order for you to share your ideas and get some help.
